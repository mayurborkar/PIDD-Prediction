## Introduction
Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PIDD) are a group of more than 300 diseases. These conditions are due to defects in the body's defenses immune system. In most cases, PIDD are associated with acute or recurrent infections, depending on the portion of the immune system affected. Most PIDD are inherited in our genes, so they are present at birth, but they often do not become apparent or diagnosed until late in childhood--or even in adult life. It often takes time for a pattern of recurrent infections or other symptoms to develop before a PIDD is suspected. There are more than 200 different genetic causes of PIDD.

### Signs that you or your child might have a PIDD include:

1. Recurrent, unusual, or difficult to treat infections
2. Poor growth or loss of weight
3. Recurrent pneumonia, ear infections or sinusitis
4. Multiple courses of antibiotics or IV antibiotics necessary to clear infections
5. Recurrent deep abscesses of the organs or skin
6. A family history of PIDD
7. Swollen lymph glands or an enlarged spleen
Some PIDD can mimic other conditions including allergy, asthma, or eczema and vice versa, so evaluation by an allergist / immunologist is extremely helpful for reaching a diagnosis and developing an effective treatment plan.

## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts the diabetic patient.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home ? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [your link here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement On Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

![Heroku ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62636740/90313301-2e337980-df29-11ea-95dd-3d9f89ecd838.png)

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.
